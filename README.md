                <h2>Prologue</h2>
<div>
<p>Like most stories, it started with a cactus, a goldfish named Timothy, ancient Egyptian pyramids, and a volcano-themed birthday cake.</p>

<p>I know what you’re thinking. What kind of story has  anything to do with any of that completely out-of-the-blue random things?!
    Wouldn’t YOU like to know. I don’t blame you, because I sure as heck did.
These next pages are going to be a lot for you. Hang in there, ‘kay?</p>
</div>
    
    
    <h2> Chapter One</h2>
<div>
<p>BEEP-BEEP. BEEP-BEEP. BEEP-BEE-Click.
<i>What time is it?</i> thinks the idiotic little voice in my head. <i>How many times did you hit the snooze button? Are we gonna be late? Ooooh, you’re always late! I bet your parents will be giving you another lecture soon!! They’ll be all like “You’ve gotta be responsible! You have a sister and your parents are busy! You’ve got to be able to manage math, history, science, English, and even band and chess club because OH, you’ll be able to maintain a social life and be able to get at least an HOUR of sleep, then!!” Yeah, totally!</i></p>
<p><i>You’re so dramatic</i>, A second voice says. I obviously prefer this one over the other one, it’s much calmer. 
Keep in mind this has been a minute since the alarm stopped and I have just realized that it’s Monday and that I am going to be tardy.
</p>
<p>I awaken with a jolt, like after you have a nightmare, and practically snapped my neck looking at the clock.
7:29. I have a literal minute until the bus gets here.
I, without thinking, leap out of bed, throw on a pair of jeans, a canary yellow t-shirt that says “It isn’t Rael” from 2 years ago, dive downstairs into the kitchen, shove the omelet sandwich into my mouth and almost forget to not chew on the glass when I drank the orange juice. I sprinted into the bathroom to brush my teeth out only to see out of the window, the bus. LEAVING.</p>
    <p>“Crud.”</p>
<p>I spit out the toothpaste and completely ditch dress code and put on flip-flops. In winter. To save time. I throw on my backpack and run out the door, the neighbor’s dog cheering me on.<p>
    <p>The bus is gone.</p>
<p>“…Not again! Ugghhh!” I voice my frustrations.</p>
